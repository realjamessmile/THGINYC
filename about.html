    <h3 class="about-text">SYNOPSIS</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">This is a coming-of-age story about two girls realizing they have agency over the choices they make after years of letting life, boys, drugs, and Tess’s cult past bend them over a table.

On April 14th, 1984, a series of unfortunate events send the girls spiraling toward rock bottom at an inextinguishable pace, forcing them to face the discomfort of living in reality, all the way down in the pits of being $5,000 in debt (approx. equivalent to $15,287.34 in 2025).

A stroke of grace leads them to the office of Rabbi Bellamy, a wise Bostonian lesbian who came of age herself at the dawn of the United States Gay rights movement, who asks them to consider what on earth they’ve been doing with their lives, and whether or not they’d like to remain asleep at the wheel. 

No, say the girls. We’d like to fuck the world back. 

Thus marks the start of the girls’ quest for world domination, as they embark on a journey to learn how to harness the full potential of their power.

    <h3 class="about-text">WRITER OF SHOW</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">Riley Stark and <a href="https://tess-lancaster.com/about/">Tess Lancaster</a></p>

      <h3 class="about-text">Have you brought this show to Edinburgh Festival Fringe before?</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">No.</p>

  <h3 class="about-text">Other Information About The Show</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">It’s really funny and good! Also, Tess is an Accessibility Coordinator and would ideally like to have at least one performance be as accessible as can be (touch tour, audio description, captioning). We are in the process of creating the audio description and captioning and would love to work with you, see what is possible, and expand the audience for the show!

  <h3 class="about-text">Managing Company</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">Toonieroonie Productions LLC</p>

  <h3 class="about-text">Information about the Company</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">Toonieroonie Productions is a comedic animation company based in Brooklyn, New York. Owners Tess Lancaster and Riley Kennedy Stark, who independently perform sketch comedy and improv, expanded the company this year to include stage performance. Toonieroonie’s first performance of The Horniest Girls in New York City was held on March 14th with The Village Salon in Manhattan. A link to the performance has been provided in the “Video Link” response section. This would be the company’s first time to Fringe (exciting!).</p>

 <h3 class="about-text">Preferred Space</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text"> Jersey </p> 

   <h3 class="about-text">Why do you like this space?</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text"> Jersey is perfect for The Horniest Girls in New York City. Our main needs are all addressed by the space:quick access to a backstage area for costume and prop changes, a wide enough stage with wingspace on either side to support our “split stage” scenes, seating space for at least one wheelchair user, great sightlines, and right under 100 seats. The venue looks beautiful, and we know our show would fit right in. Also, we would most likely be flying to you from the New Jersey airport, so it would be great if we could tell everyone what the real Jersey is like when we return home. </p> 

  <h3 class="about-text">Preferred Space - 2nd Choicey</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text"> Belly Button </p>

 <h3 class="about-text">Preferred Space - 3rd Choice</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text"> Big Belly </p> 

<h3 class="about-text">Preferred Time of Day - 1st Choice </h3>
    <p class="white-box-text"> Afternoon </p>

  <h3 class="about-text">Preferred Time of Day - 2nd Choice</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text"> Late Afternoon </p>

  <h3 class="about-text">Desired Length of Run</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">Shorter run</p>

  <h3 class="about-text">Limited Run Dates</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">We can make any dates work.</p>

  <h3 class="about-text">Days Off</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">None needed.</p>

  <h3 class="about-text">Technical Requirements</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">We will be using flickering and blackout lighting to signify scene changes, and we have approximately 6 sound queues to play pre-recorded sound.</p>

  <h3 class="about-text">Get In/ Get Out Requirements</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">We just need time to pack up our props, which fit in two large bags. We will have a stage manager to assist. 15 minutes in and out will be very easy. We can do it in 10.</p>

    <br>

  <h3 class="about-text">Are there any special effects that it would be useful for us to be aware of?</h3>
    <p class="white-box-text">No.</p>
